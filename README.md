Machine Learning ICA

Prediction of Breast Cancer using logistic regression and Random Foreest Algorithm


The Notebook is as easy as it seems, you can download it with the dataset import it into the Workspace and run each code line by line.

I worked with 2 datasets here.

The first datasets has less row which is required for my ICA.

Which is why I decided to go for the updated datasets which has over 5000 rows and over 30 features 

I Plan on splitting the dating using 20% for testing and 80% for training.

The Algorithms to be used are 

Logistic Regression 
Random Forest Algorithm
Support vector Machine
